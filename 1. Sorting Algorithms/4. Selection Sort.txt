The SELECTION sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element (considering ascending order) from unsorted part and putting it at the beginning.

The algorithm maintains two subarrays in a given array.
1) The subarray which is already sorted. 
2) Remaining subarray which is unsorted.
In every iteration of selection sort, the minimum element (considering ascending order) from the unsorted subarray is picked and moved to the sorted subarray.

The maximum number of swaps in selection sort are O(N) and maximum number of comparisons are O(N^2).

Time Complexity: O(N^2)
Space Compexity: O(1)

CODE:

for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++)
{
    int k, j;
    for (k = j = i; j < n; j++)
    {
	if (arr[j] < arr[i])
	    k = j;
    }

    swap(arr[k], arr[i]);
}

The selection sort algorithm is niether stable nor adaptive.
