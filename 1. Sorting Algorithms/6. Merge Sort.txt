Merging two arrays in a sorted array.

sortArrays(int arr1[], int arr2[], int n, int m)
{
    int arr[m + n];

    int i = 0, j = 0, k = 0;

    while (i < n && j < m)
    {
          if (arr1[i] < arr2[j])
		arr[k++] = arr1[i++];
          else
		arr[k++] = arr1[j++];
    }

    while (i < n)
	arr[k++] = arr[i++];

    while (j < m)
	arr[k++] = arr[j++];

    return arr;
}

So, this way we can sort two already sorted arrays in a single sorted array. Similarly we can also sort m sorted arrays in a single sorted array. This technique is 
called m-way sorting.

We can also use two-way sorting where we sort m arrays taking two at a time.

This is also used in merge sort.
