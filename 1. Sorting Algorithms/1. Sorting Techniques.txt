A SORTING algorithm is an algorithm that puts elements of a list in a certain order.

Criteria for analysis:

1. Number of comparisons
2. Number of swaps
3. Adaptive - If the array is already sorted take minimum time to finish sorting.
4. Stable - If the array is sorted on some criteria and we change the criteria. Now, if we have duplicates we need to preserve the original order of the elements.
   Ex. 
         Student - A B C D E F G H
	   Marks - 1 3 4 5 6 7 5 5
   Above the items are sorted on the basis of names if we sort them on the basis of marks, then we have 3 duplicates of 5. So, we need to preserve original order i.e.,
   D, G, H.


Note: Bubble, insertion and merge are the only adaptive sort techniques.
      Bubble and insertion are the only stable sort techniques.
